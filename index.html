    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>My favourite hobby is reading books. I enjoy reading because it helps my imagination go wild, and it also takes me traveling all over the world just while sitting in one chair in a corner. Reading calms me down and helps me focus. Reading also has many academic benefits, like improving my spelling, grammar, punctuation and others. It also helps me increase the number of words I know and can use in my everyday life. Most books also have morals, or lessons you can learn and apply in your day-to-day life.</p>

<p>I have also published my own book! It is called "London Here I Come- How I Saved For My Dream Vacation". It is about money, and how to save it and covers a lot of topics related to money like budgeting, real-life experiences and a lot more.</p>

<p>My inspiration is my mother. She runs her own financial planning firm, and is also a published author. Along with those two, she somehow finds time to be the best mother on earth!</p>
